# html_css-layouting
Introduction to html and css layouting by creating a poster.

This project is a an animated poster. It portrays a made up horror film festival with several screenings of popular (and my favourite) horror films.

I used VSCode to create the poster and Figma to create the "buy your tickets now" image. One of the challenges in this project was trying to organise the images and text so that it fit well together and I am very happy that I managed to figure out how to use CSS grids. I enjoy the layouting in css and exploring different tools, for example being able to animate images/text and editing images within the css document.
